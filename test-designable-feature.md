# Designable Feature Test Results

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Category Service - Design Upcharge Percentage
**Problem:** The `designUpchargePercent` field was not being returned from the API even though it was saved in the database.
**Solution:** Added `designUpchargePercent` field to the `toCategory` function in `categoryService.ts`

### 2. Product Service - CategoryId Conversion  
**Problem:** Products stored with ObjectId categoryId were returning undefined categoryId through the API.
**Solution:** Modified `productService.ts` to convert ObjectId to string when returning products:
- `mapProductToResponse` method
- `getProductById` method

### 3. Product Assignment
**Problem:** No products were assigned to the Apparel category for testing.
**Solution:** Assigned T-shirt products to the Apparel category with the script.
