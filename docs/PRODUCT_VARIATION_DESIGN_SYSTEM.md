# Product Variation & Design System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive system for managing product variations with individual design frames, seamless design tool integration, and user-specific design persistence.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Product Configuration (Admin Dashboard)
- **Frame Management**: Each product variation can have unique designable area boundaries
- **Variation Support**: Products can have multiple variations with individual settings
- **Responsive Frames**: Design boundaries adapt to screen size while maintaining aspect ratio
- **Price Calculation**: Real-time price updates based on design area (cm²)

### 2. Design Tool Integration
- **Seamless Switching**: Users can switch between variations without losing designs
- **Persistent Designs**: Each variation maintains its own design for front/back/left/right views
- **User-Specific Storage**: Designs are linked to user accounts, not globally visible
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes in admin dashboard immediately reflect in design tool

### 3. User Experience Flow
```
Product Selection → Variation Choice → Design Creation → Review → Purchase
                        ↑                    ↓
                        └── Switch Variation ←┘
```

## Technical Architecture

### Data Models

#### Product Model Enhancement
```typescript
interface Product {
  // Existing fields...
  isDesignable: boolean
  designFrames: DesignFrame[]
  designCostPerCm2: number
  variations: Variation[]
}

interface Variation {
  id: string
  color: Color
  price: number
  designFrames: DesignFrame[] // Per-variation frames
  // Each variation can override product-level frames
}

interface DesignFrame {
  id: string
  position: string // "front", "back", "left", "right"
  x: number // Position in pixels
  y: number
  width: number // Size in cm
  height: number
  widthPercent: number // Responsive percentage
  heightPercent: number
  xPercent: number
  yPercent: number
  costPerCm2: number
  variationId?: string // Optional variation binding
  angle?: string // View angle
}
```

#### User Design Storage
```typescript
interface UserDesign {
  id: string
  userId: string
  productId: string
  variationId: string
  viewMode: string // "front", "back", etc.
  canvasJSON: object // Fabric.js canvas data
  designAreaCm2: number
  designAreaPercentage: number
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### State Management

#### Redux Slices
1. **designSlice**: Manages current design state
2. **variationSlice**: Handles variation-specific data
3. **canvasSlice**: Controls Fabric.js canvas state

#### Local Storage
- Temporary design persistence before user login
- Migration to database after authentication
